# Joker
- Joker is an android app that shows the power of Gradle in android builds and development
- With this app it is shown that how to create multiple variants like Free, Paid, Demo, Full, Freemium app from single code base without having to code whole app again and again
- In each variant of the app can have it's unique features like in free version of the app ads are seen frequently but in Paid version the app is ad free completely thus reducing the apk size by not including relevant dependencies from paid versions
- In this example the free version of app shows ads and Paid version is ad free and have feature like night mode that changes theme dark
- In Joker, It is shown how to create our own android library to produce and supply joke as creating the own custom created libraries is a crucial step towards modular development of apps and makes development, maintenance and testing of big apps easy
- Learn to build apps witih Gradle to improve build quality and also modularity of app
- If the app is used as 2 versions this is especially useful as we don not have to create two different code bases for the app only one wil be enough
- This can also be useful for diff features of the app made by diff teams at a time
- Google Endpoints are used to get the jokes from library and supply to android app to get idea of how the data might be fetched from the server in reallife
